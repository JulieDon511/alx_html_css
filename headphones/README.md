# Implement a Design from Scratch ðŸŽ§

This project is part of the ALX Front-End Web Development program. The goal is to recreate a designerâ€™s mockup using only HTML and CSS â€” no JavaScript (except in Task 8), and no external libraries or frameworks.

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

Rebuild a responsive landing page from a Figma design provided by UI/UX Designer Nicolas Philippot. The project covers core front-end topics: layout structure, responsiveness, accessibility, and UI design.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Responsive Media Queries)
- No external CSS frameworks
- JavaScript (only for hamburger menu)

## ðŸ–¼ Preview

This is a static web page based on the design available [here](https://www.figma.com/). Final responsive views include a header, services section, statistics, contact form, and footer.
